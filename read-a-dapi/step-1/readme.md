## 1. Add npm package

dAPI proxies allows dAPIs to be used like libraries. Your smart contract needs
to import the `IProxy` interface to call a dAPI's proxy contract. You can add
the [@api3/contracts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@api3/contracts) package to
your project and get access to the IProxy interface contract.

```
npm i @api3/contracts
```
