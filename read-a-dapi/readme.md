# Reading a dAPI proxy

This guide requires a proxy contract address for a particular dAPI you are
interested in. You can find them in the [API3 Market](https://market.api3.org)
website. If a proxy contract has not been created for a particular dAPI use the
API3 Market UI to do so, see the guide
[Subscribing to dAPIs](/guides/dapis/subscribing-to-dapis/).
